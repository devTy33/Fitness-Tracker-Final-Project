## Issues I Worked On

- Fix Calender Background[Issue 57] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/57)
- Add Meals to mealplanner[Issue 58] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/58)
- Add images to meal planner{Issue 59] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/59)

## Files I Worked On
-Some of these shows that they were commited by Ty but the MealPlanner and Calendar component were done by me and Ty just took them from my file and added the routing to get it merged in the working directory. 
- workingDirectory/client/src/MealPlanner.js (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/MealPlanner.js) 
- workingDirectory/client/src/CalendarComponent.js (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/CalendarComponent.js)
- workingDirectory/client/src/App.Css (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/App.css)


## What I Accomplished
-   Added more meals to meal planner and sections for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fixed Calendar css.
