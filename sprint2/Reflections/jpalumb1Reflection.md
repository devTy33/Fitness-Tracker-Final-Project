### What you planned to do

- I planned to authenticate users login through database  [#20](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/20)
- I planned to start saving other user info like weight and other things  [#21](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/21)

### What you did not do

 [#21](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/21) - did not get to implement yet

### Files you worked on

- workingDirectory/server/index.js

- workingDirectory/client/src/App.js

### What you accomplished
I added a quick signup page to be able to test the backend of the user authentication. From this I was able to send new users name and password to our database,
then I was also able to implement the login to call to look and see if user name and password where in the database and if so to accept. I could add more into
this like email for forgotten password or other things like that but for now this would due and hopefully can use the database in storing user data for next sprint.
