## What I Planned

- Create meal planner
- Create CSS for meal planner
- Update Calendar Commponent
  
## What I Did Not Do

- I was unable to finish MealPlaanner need to create more meals and update existing ones. As long as add photos

## Problems Encountered

- Figuring out the routing between pages
- Trying to merge with Group in GitHub

## Issues I Worked On

- CSS for Meal planner[Issue 22] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/22)
- Add Meals to mealplanner [Issue 23] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/23)

## Files I Worked On
-Some of these shows that they were commited by Ty but the MealPlanner and Calendar component were done by me and Ty just took them from my file and added the routing to get it merged in the working directory. 
- workingDirectory/client/src/MealPlanner.js (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/MealPlanner.js) 
- workingDirectory/client/src/CalendarComponent.js (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/CalendarComponent.js)
- workingDirectory/client/src/App.Css (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/App.css)


## What I Accomplished
- I accomplished adding the Meal Planner and the Meal Planner Css. I also Add meals to it and a summary of why meal planning is important. I also updated the calendar commponent. My code has been merged and is working on the main working directory. I learned about how to route pages together and I lerned more about using GitHub. I also have a clearer vision of what I need to work on and fix for Sprint 3.
