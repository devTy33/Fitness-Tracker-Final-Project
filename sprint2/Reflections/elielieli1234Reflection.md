# Sprint 2

- Eli Dayney, elielieli1234, TrendStrength Fitness Tracker

## What I planned to do
- Scaling with resizable windows working on the login page for each constituent element
- Submit button with login rejection animations
- Retrieve login information in JavaScript file
- Connect login with the database and check for proper login information
- Route the user to the home page upon successful login

## What I did not do
- Connect login with the database and check for proper login information
- Route the user to the home page upon successful login

### What problems I encountered
- Submit button was moving with the login title

### Issues I worked on
- I worked on allowing users that sign up to log in through the database
    - [Issue #20](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/20)
- I worked on creating basic user authentication
    - [Issue #13](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/13)

### Files I worked on
- sprint_2-eli/App.css
- sprint_2-eli/App.js
- sprint_2-eli/index.html

## What I accomplished
I got everything set up to route the login page with the backend. The only difficult part here
is connecting other people's code with my own because I am still a little uncomfortable with Git.
I made the functionality of the login page better; the scaling is looking better, though I could
have made things more complicated if I would have liked to. The background image is now just sufficiently
large to fit on my monitor, so there is no more whitespace between it and the bottom of the window.
The submit button, title screen, and input fields are all part of the same class now so their
relative scaling remains fixed. The only things left to do on the login page now would be to fix
the text box that sits in the background and provide an informative bar at the bottom. I also need to
route this to the signup page. In short, I continued working on the login page and implemented most
of the functionality for the functions we'll need to route it to the backend.
