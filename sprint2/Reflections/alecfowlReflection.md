**TrendStrength Fitness App**

## What I Planned

- Learn how to implement HTML
- Create exercise gallery page
- Format gallery page
- Make clickable link
- Connect gallery to exercise list
  
## What I Did Not Do

- I was unable to properly connect to gallery page and the exercise list

## Problems Encountered

- Took awhile to understand how to make the front-end stuff
- Used the wrong implementation for the clickable link

## Issues I Worked On

- Create the Exercise Page Sprint 2 [Issue 24] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/24)
- Make a Clickable Link from Exercise Page Sprint 2 [Issue 25] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/25)
- Format the Exercise Page to Look Good Sprint 2 [Issue 26] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/26)

## Files I Worked On

- I had to learn how to create the gallery page so I worked on a few files that were needed for it to run:
- /workingDirectory/client/src/exPage.jsx: App funtion to run ImageGallery.
- /workingDirectory/client/src/ImageDisplay.jsx: Where most of the work was done, formatting and how the images and texts were created.
- /workingDirectory/client/src/galleryConnection.js: Used to connect the file together, doesn't work correctly yet.
- /workingDirectory/client/src/main.jsx: Main for the gallery to run and connect.
- These are the pictures I added to the project:
- /workingDirectory/client/public/arms.jpg
- /workingDirectory/client/public/chest.jpg
- /workingDirectory/client/public/back.jpg
- /workingDirectory/client/public/abs.jpg
- /workingDirectory/client/public/shoulder.jpg
- /workingDirectory/client/public/legs.jpg

## What I Accomplished

I have created the main exercise page that will be the first thing that the users will see when wanting to create a workout plan or
have a shortcut to look at the exercises that have to deal with each muscle group projected. I have learned a basic understanding on
how to connect the files and almost got it to correctly connect the files for the easiest use of the user. Formatting the page took
some time learning all of the things I wanted to do with it but I believe it looks very good and will remain the way it is until the
end of the project.
