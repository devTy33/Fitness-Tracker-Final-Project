# Sprint 2

Ty Anderson, devty33, trend-strenght-fitness-tracker

### what you planned to do

I planned on configuring a working directory with both client and server folders that the working files could be added to so we have a unified devloplement space. I also planned on setting up the routes for all of our pages as well as integrating them to the navbar on the home page. I planned on connecting the api with the data base to get the fill functionality out of login page.

### what you did not do

Jusing took over the responsibility of connecting the api to the data base to achieve full login functionality. 

### what problems were encountered

None

### files you worked on
 - https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/App.js

 - https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/home.js

 The commit history will show that I worked on every file in this folder: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/tree/main/workingDirectory/client. I didn't write the code for most of these, I jsut tweeked them and configured them to all work together in the same directory and run off the same page.

### What you accomplished 

The files are no longer scattered in random folders, they are organized and configured in the workingDirectory folder. Client contains the react code and server contains the backend (express and mongoose). The react components are now also all linked together through routes in the App.js file. You can now also visit all the different pages from the home page.
