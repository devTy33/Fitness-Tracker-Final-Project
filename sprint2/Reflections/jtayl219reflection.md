# Riley's Reflection
**TrendStrength Fitness App**

## What I Planned

- Work On Workout Paget
- Include exercises for each muscle group
- Add Images to showcase each exercise
- Connect to Homepage and Exercise gallery
  
## What I Did Not Do

- Unable to Conncect to homepage or exercise gallery due to some issues, should be able to fix

## Problems Encountered

- Issues connecting website to main page and exercise gallery
- Had to make each webpage individually, likely not the most effecient

## Issues I Worked On

- Create Workoutpage for the exercise gallery [Issue 16] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/16)
- Complete the front-end for each muscle group's workout page [Issue 17] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/17)
- Connect Workout Page to homepage and exercise gallery [Issue 18] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/18)

## Files I Worked On

- Created 5 different webpages for each muscle group
- /Muscle Groups/Arm page/
- /Muscle Groups/Back page/
- /Muscle Groups/Chest page/
- /Muscle Groups/Leg page/
- /Muscle Groups/Shoulder Page/

## What I Accomplished

I created 5 different webpages that shows specific exercises for muscle groups including Arms, Back, Chest, Legs, and Shoulders. 
This will connect to the exercise gallery and when you click on the specific muscle, it will show images and names of each exercise.
