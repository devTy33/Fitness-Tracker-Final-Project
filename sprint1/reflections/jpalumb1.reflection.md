### What you planned to do
I planned on creating a database #8 //github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/8
I planned on connecting to database #7 //github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/7
lastly I planned on adding user info to the database #9 //github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/9

### What you did not do
I was not able to add users info to the data base

### What problems you encountered
One problem that I have ran into is that the database is set up to have approved IP addresses
so I need to change this so it can run the CRUD commands (adding info and pulling info from database) 
from anywhere

### Issues you worked on
#7 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/7

#9 https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/9

### Files you worked on
I worked on database.js 
the path: database.js
link: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/database.js

### What you accomplished
The things I accplomplished was created a mongoDB atlas data base and collection. I set a username and paswword for the database.
I added a connection through the database.js file and a demo on how to access the database name ond other info. I made the mongoDB a client
Other things I did through sprint 1 was learn about how mongoDB is a non SQL database. Learned how information was stored, leanred how to acess information.
I also set up a mongoDB shell allowing to make changes to the database right from the terminal and to allow connections to the database through the terminal as well.
