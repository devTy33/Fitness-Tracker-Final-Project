###What I planned to do
- Create Front Page
- 1, https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/1, Create Front Page
- Add users and other info to database
- 9, https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/9

### What I did not do
- Add users and other info to database
- 9, https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/9
- Add enter button that initiates connection with backend (Something I didn't consider in the issues part of the repo)

### What problems you encountered
- Both the input bars would grow indefinetely when users inputted passwords, so they'd stretch across the whole page
- The scale of the images would not change with the size of the window, so that parts of the page were out of place
- Correcting the z-scale of the box element that encapsulates the username and password fields so that it displays behind both
- Extra username and input fields displayed at the bottom of the page

### Issues you worked on
- Create Front Page
    - 1, https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/1, Create Front Page
    - Add username input field
    - Add password input field
    - Stylize frontend with background image
    - Stylize with grey container in background of input fields
    - Add enter button that initiates connection with backend
    - Connect user input with backend

### Files you worked on
- src->public->index.html, src->src->App.js, src->src->App.css, src->src->App.js, src->src->background.jpg

### What you accomplished
I was kind of drudging through the learning curve, 
but I got react up and running, 
and started putting elements in the html file and stylizing them in the css file.
It took me a while but I started by getting a solid colored background. 
After that I added a username and input field, 
where it displayed the text that was entered into the box. 
That part was handled in the .js file. 
Once I knew that was fine,
I removed the display of the username and password. 
I then added a box surrounding the input fields, 
and moved it behind them.
Next I added a title screen and, like all the other elements I had to play around with the padding. 
Finally, I found an image online of a black "workout" sillhouette to fit Riley's homepage theme.
I fooled around with adding low opacity banners but I thought it looked best as is.
I wound up with an okay looking front end for a login screen.
