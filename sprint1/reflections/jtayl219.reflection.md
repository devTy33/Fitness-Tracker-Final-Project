**TrendStrength Fitness App**

## What I Planned

- Install React/node.js
- Research how to use html/css
- Create homepage

## What I Did Not Do

- Link the buttons to our calender, etc.
- finish the homepage and nutrition page

## Problems Encountered

- Struggled to format pictures for the website
- Had trouble figuring out the buttons for the website and getting the color scheme correct

## Issues I Worked On
- Creating the homepage (issue #1) https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/1
- Creating progess page (issue #2) https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/2
- Creating nutrition page (issue #3) https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/3

## Files I Worked On

- I worked on the files in the homepage folder
- This includes html/react front end things as well as css for the website

## What I Accomplished

- I sucessfully created the front end for the homepage of our website
- It has a nice design and the css should work for other pages we create to make it easier
