# Riley's Reflection
**TrendStrength Fitness App**

## What I Planned

- Create a Workout Split Page
- Connect to the Homescreen
- Add Images to showcase workout split
- Create an Ab exercise Page
  
## What I Did Not Do

- Fix the Header for workout pages as they are uncentered

## Problems Encountered

- Issues with conflicting css files
- issues connecting pages

## Issues I Worked On

- Create Ab Page for workout gallery [Issue 41] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/41)
- Add front-end/styling to workout split [Issue 40] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/40)
- Create and connect workout split to the homepage [Issue 39] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/39)

## Files I Worked On

- /Muscle Groups/Ab Page/
- /workingDirectory/client/src/planner.jsx

## What I Accomplished

I create a workout split page that connects to the home page via a button. I also created the ab workout page showcasing different ab exercises for the workout gallery.
