Justin Palumbo, github: jpalumbo64, netid: jpalumb1, group: TrendStrengthFitness

### What you planned to do
- push height,weight,age,gender and calorie needs data into database.  [#21](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/21)
- create a run analyzer and add make it clickable through home page. [#49](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/49)
- add the calorie calc to home page and add router for it. [#48](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/48)

### What you did not do
-I was not able to pull data from database we only have it set up to use on a one local machine
-so we have to get a better user aunthication or only use database functionality on a local machine

### What problems you encountered
- we ran into some database promblems but I think it's fixable to be able to authenicate using mongodb app services

### Files you worked on
- workingDirectory/server/index.js
- workingDirectory/client/src/App.js
- workingDirectory/client/src/CalCount.js
- workingDirectory/client/src/home.js
- workingDirectory/client/src/runAnalyzer.jsx

### What you accomplished
I accomplished a decent amount this sprint. I was able to add/connect another feature/page that is a simply run analyzer where you enter time and milage 
and you get pace and calories back, this could be better and give some more insight but it works good now. Next I was able to connect smits calorie 
calculator and add a route through the home page so now that's connected. Lastly I set up smits calorie calculator to push the data into the database and in
the future I want to make it so you fill it in once when you sign up and then it saves and you don't have to edit it.
