# Smit's Reflection
**TrendStrength Fitness App**

## What I Planned

- Fix the errors in the cal counter
- Add a activity option
- Convert Feet and inches into cm
- Convert pound into kg 
  
## What I Did Not Do

- I was not able finish the activity tracker (I have it mostly finished)

## Problems Encountered

- I had problems converting the feet and inches into cm and having the calculation work properly 
- Had problems with formatting the page

## Issues I worked on 
- Convert Feet and Inches into CM [Issue 45] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/45
- Convert Pound into KG [Issue 46] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/46
- Activity Tracker [Issue 47] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/47

## Files I Worked On

- CalCount.js
- CalCount.css

## What I Accomplished
- I was able to make it so that the user can input feet and inches and the calculator would automatically convert it into cm so that the 
user didn't have to do that, I also did the same for pound and kg. And I also added a activity tab to ask user how active they are and based on that it will give them macros.
