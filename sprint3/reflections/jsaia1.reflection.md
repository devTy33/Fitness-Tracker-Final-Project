## Files I Worked On
-Some of these shows that they were commited by Ty but the MealPlanner and Calendar component were done by me and Ty just took them from my file and added the routing to get it merged in the working directory. 
- workingDirectory/client/src/MealPlanner.js (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/MealPlanner.js) 
- workingDirectory/client/src/CalendarComponent.js (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/CalendarComponent.js)
- workingDirectory/client/src/App.Css (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/blob/main/workingDirectory/client/src/App.css)


## What I Accomplished
-   Added more meals to meal planner and added Images of the dishes. Fixed CSS for Meal Planner and Calendar.
