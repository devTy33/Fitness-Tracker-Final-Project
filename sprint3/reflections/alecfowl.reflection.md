**TrendStrength Fitness App**

## What I Planned

- learn how to make a css
- Learn connection between front end functions
- Clean up gallery
- Make workout pages look good
  
## What I Did Not Do

- Create home and calendar buttons on the workout pages

## Problems Encountered

- css caused MANY problems with the style of workout pages
- Had trouble getting the pictures to show up due to wrong programming

## Issues I Worked On

- Connect Riley's workouts to gallery [Issue 36] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/36)
- Figure out how to style is outside of home style [Issue 37] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/37)
- Clean up gallery for more inclusion [Issue 38] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/TrendStrength-Fitness-Tracker/issues/38)

## Files I Worked On

- Files to get gallery and workout pages to connect and run:
- /workingDirectory/client/src/App.js
- /workingDirectory/client/src/ImageDisplay.jsx
- /workingDirectory/client/src/home.js
- /workingDirectory/client/src/arm.js
- /workingDirectory/client/src/abs.jsx
- /workingDirectory/client/src/chest.jsx
- /workingDirectory/client/src/back.jsx
- /workingDirectory/client/src/shoulder.jsx
- /workingDirectory/client/src/legs.jsx
- These are the pictures I used for the project:

## What I Accomplished

I was able to properly connect the front-end pages in the gallery to the workout screens that show several workouts for each body part.
This was harder than I expected it to be because Riley had made .css files for them but they were messing up the other files that were
using .css styles and it took me a long time to figure this out. There was also an issue with the pictures not working but there 
was a line of code that caused the issue so it was an easy fix. I feel like the connection to the workouts and the workouts themselves
are perfect for our design and it is perfect for the users who are unaware of certain exercises to complete.
